      "@value": "My motivation stems from a deep commitment to decentralization, equity, and innovation within the Cardano ecosystem. Small SPOs are the backbone of a truly decentralized network, and supporting their sustainability is essential to preserve Cardano’s vision. Similarly, the Hispanic community, often underrepresented, deserves a strong voice to ensure inclusivity and global accessibility. I believe in fostering a stable, reliable, and resilient Cardano network by prioritizing security, scalability, and robust infrastructure. Additionally, I am driven by the need to champion the developers and contributors whose work fuels Cardano’s technical and ideological progress. Promoting collaboration, transparency, and a balance between technical evolution and community needs motivates me to represent and advocate effectively, ensuring Cardano thrives as a global, decentralized platform."
